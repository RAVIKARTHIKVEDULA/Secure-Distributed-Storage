Secure Distributed File Storage with Client-Side Encryption, DHT Coordination, and Advanced Web UI

🎯 Project Objective

Build a web-based secure distributed file storage prototype accessible entirely through a browser.
Users should be able to upload and download files securely, where all encryption happens client-side, and encrypted file chunks are distributed across logical storage nodes coordinated by a central backend.

This is an academic prototype, not a production decentralized cloud.

🧱 System Architecture (Core Requirements)
Deployment Model

Frontend deployed as a web application

Users access the system through a browser only

No local setup or code execution required for users

Backend deployed centrally as a coordinator

🔐 Security Model

Client-side encryption using Web Crypto API

Generate a random AES-256-GCM key per file

Encrypt files in the browser before upload

Encrypt AES key using RSA public key (per session)

Use SHA-256 for chunk integrity verification

Backend must never receive plaintext files or private keys

📂 File Processing Pipeline

Encrypt file on client

Split encrypted file into fixed-size chunks

Generate SHA-256 hash per chunk

Use hash as chunk identifier

Distribute chunks across nodes

Replicate each chunk on at least two logical nodes

🌐 Distributed Storage Model

Simulate 3 logical storage nodes

Nodes are logical abstractions, not physical laptops

Encrypted chunks stored in backend-managed storage

Node failure must be simulatable without data loss

🗂 DHT-Like Metadata

Implement a DHT-style mapping:

chunk_hash → [node_id_1, node_id_2]


Metadata stored separately from chunks

No centralized plaintext file index

🔄 File Retrieval Flow

User requests file via browser

Backend queries DHT for chunk locations

Encrypted chunks retrieved from nodes

Client verifies hashes (SHA-256)

AES key decrypted client-side

File reconstructed in browser

🧭 Multi-Page UI Flow (Mandatory)

Use client-side routing. Each page must have one clear responsibility.

Required Routes
/            → Landing Page
/session     → Local Session Setup
/upload      → Secure File Upload
/storage     → Distributed Nodes Dashboard
/files       → File List & Download
/architecture→ Architecture & Data Flow
/logs        → Activity Logs


Navigation must not reload the page.

🎨 UI / UX Design Requirements
Design Language

Modern, professional, security-focused UI

Dark-first theme with optional light mode

Clean typography, consistent spacing

Subtle gradients, soft shadows

Minimalist, calm visual style

Page Responsibilities
🏠 Landing Page

Project title & short explanation

CTA: Start Secure Session

Secondary CTA: View Architecture

Simple fade-in animation

🔐 Session Page

Local session name input

RSA key generation indicator

Clear note: Keys are stored locally in browser

Button → redirect to Upload page

📤 Upload Page

Drag-and-drop upload zone

Upload button

Data-flow animation triggered here

Visual pipeline:

Encrypt → Chunk → Hash → Distribute


On success → redirect to Storage page

🗄 Storage Dashboard

Visual display of 3 logical nodes

Chunk count per node

Node status (Active / Disabled)

Toggle node failure & recovery

Clear explanation text

📁 Files Page

List of uploaded files

Metadata: size, upload time

Download button

Verification & reconstruction animation

Message: File decrypted locally

🧠 Architecture Page

Interactive system diagram

Components:

Client

Encryption Layer

DHT

Storage Nodes

Button to replay data-flow animation

📜 Logs Page

Timestamped logs

Color-coded events

Scrollable, pause-friendly

Logs must sync with animations

🔁 Data Flow Animation (Optimized & Efficient)
Animation Principles

State-driven (not time-based)

Short (300–800 ms per step)

No looping or distracting effects

UI-only (must not affect logic)

Upload Animation Sequence

File icon appears in browser

Lock icon overlays → Encryption

File splits into chunks with short hashes

Chunks move to DHT panel

Chunks distribute to nodes

Replicated paths shown clearly

Download Animation

Chunks move from nodes → client

Hash verification ticks appear

Lock opens

File reconstructs visually

Node Failure Animation

Disabled node fades / turns red

Chunk path rerouted to replica

Text: Replica used for recovery

🧩 Animation & Routing Rules

Animations are page-scoped

Upload animations only on /upload

Node animations only on /storage

Architecture animations only on /architecture

🛠 Tech Stack Constraints

Frontend: React + Tailwind CSS

Routing: React Router

Animations: Framer Motion

Backend: Node.js / Firebase Functions / Supabase

Crypto: Web Crypto API

❌ Explicit Non-Goals

No blockchain

No cryptocurrency

No real peer-to-peer storage

No physical disk usage from user laptops

No IPFS-level decentralization

🎯 Expected Output

Fully working deployed web app

Smooth multi-page navigation

Clear, explainable animations

Stable demo suitable for viva

Professional UI/UX resembling a product MVP

📎 Mandatory Scope Statement

This project demonstrates secure distributed storage using logical nodes and client-side encryption. Physical peer storage and full decentralization are intentionally excluded to ensure reliability and clarity in an academic setting.
